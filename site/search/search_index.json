She has won awards for both research and teaching, most recently Kenyon\u2019s Senior Faculty Trustee Teaching Award. Currently, she is developing a Digital Humanities program unique to Kenyon. Her many lectures on French literature and the modern novel are available on audible.com, and her research has been published in journals like Comparative Literature Studies, Modern Language Quarterly, Modernism/Modernity, Discourse and The French Review. She has also presented research at conferences both nationally and internationally, and is editor and contributor of the Oxford Studies in Literature and Philosophy: Proust (forthcoming). She and Jon Chun are presently developing new computational approaches to literary analysis. AREAS OF EXPERTISE Professor Elkins\u2019 research interests include literature and philosophy, modernist studies, cognitive studies, artificial intelligence, digital humanities and cultural analytics.

As a post-graduate American Heart Research Fellow, he conducted and published research in both gene therapy and medical informatics. He has also worked for the Advanced Light Source Group at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the semiconductor research consortium SEMATECH in Austin. His research interests include Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing and Affective AI. Professor Chun has co-founded several startups including as CEO and COO of the world\u2019s largest anonymity service backed by large Wall Street hedge funds and the CIA\u2019s venture fund In-Q-Tel. His specialization in cross-cultural experiences of technology stems from working and studying throughout the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America including the US Foreign Service Spanish Exam and the \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u80fd\u529b\u8a66\u9a13 (Japanese). Before arriving in Gambier he was a Director of Development for the world\u2019s largest computer security corporations in Silicon Valley and Entrepreneur in Residence at UC Berkeley. Jon is interested in bringing diverse voices to urgent debates surrounding technology\u2019s growing impact on society.

Digital humanities also explores the most recent computational approaches as a way to augment \u2014 rather than replace \u2014 more traditional humanist inquiry. Students imagine and pursue new avenues of research by identifying unexplored datasets of text, image and sound, while embracing new computational frameworks that are increasingly powerful and easy to use.

This course presumes some coding experience or the introductory course to Digital Humanities, Programming Humanity. We\u2019ll build on our skills using API\u2019s to create original datasets from social media sites like Twitter. Then we\u2019ll develop natural language processing skills including sentiment analysis and topic clustering to explore text for insights.

In the final segment of the course, students develop their own project centered on their interests. This course assumes basic familiarity with Python or other programming language as taught in IPHS200: Programming Humanity. This course focuses on methodologies as well as some of the the most popular and useful technologies for computational digital humanities. By the end of this course you will: Deepen your proficiency in Python, data visualization, and data wrangling Learn core Natural Language Processing techniques including scraping, cleaning, transforming and analyzing text Learn fundamental geospatial mapping Learn fundamental graph theory and applications Be able to present your work online in both static and dynamic web servers EDIT Gain a foundational understanding of key aspects of our Age of Information from Dataism and Information Theory to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Relate this emerging picture to conversations about Humanism, Posthumanism, and Transhumanism. Understand how new computational tools both challenge and deepen traditional approaches to the Social Sciences, Humanities, and Fine Arts. Understand emerging ethical debates surrounding key technologies poised to transform humanity. Have a portfolio of project-based work demonstrating your computational skills with a final project of your choice. Assignments 20% Attendance and Discussion 25% Quizzes 15% Mini-projects 25% Python programming exercises (10) 15% Final Project (1) Moodle gradebook will be updated regularly. Attendance In accordance with standard Kenyon policy, absences greater than 25% of the class will result in a failing grade. Quizzes Short quizzes will test comprehension of key terms and information. Quizzes cannot be made up if you miss class, but the lowest grade will be dropped. Mini-Projects and Final Project You will receive a free Datacamp account with assignments due for each class session. Assignments are graded solely on completion, but you must complete them fully (i.e. no 0\u2019s). Mini Projects will be assigned on DataCamp. They are more challenging and depending on the level of difficulty, we may use class time and group work to complete them. Final Thoughts on Grades This class is meant to be a fun and exploratory introduction. Students will bring different strengths and backgrounds to this interdisciplinary class, and the emphasis will be on developing these personal interests and competencies. If you do the work, you will do well. Responsible Employee Information We will be studying and/or discussing a number of issues that may cause discomfort or distress. If you wish to speak with either of us about any readings, assignments or class discussions, please understand that we may be required to report information about sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator. For confidential support, you may contact the following resources: The Health and Counseling Center, Sexual Misconduct Advisors (SMAs) the College chaplains, and staff at New Directions Domestic Abuse Shelter & Rape Crisis Center. Statement of Academic Integrity and Disability Accommodations At Kenyon we expect all students, at all times, to submit work that represents the highest standards of academic integrity. It is the responsibility of each student to learn and practice the proper ways of documenting and acknowledging those whose ideas and words they have drawn upon (see Academic Honesty and Questions of Plagiarism in the Course Catalog). Ignorance and carelessness are not excuses for academic dishonesty. If you are uncertain about the expectations for this class, please ask for clarification. Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may need academic accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see me as soon as possible. Also, you are required to register for support services with the Office of Disability Services in the Olin Library, Center for Innovative Pedagogy.
