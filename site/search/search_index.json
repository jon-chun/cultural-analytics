This course presumes some coding experience or the introductory course to Digital Humanities, IPHS 200 Programming Humanity or even more advanced course IPHS 300 AI for the Humanities . We begin with visualizing and analyzing geospatial data via maps and charts. We\u2019ll build our skills with web scraping and API\u2019s to create original datasets from websites and services like Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Then we\u2019ll study a vareity of natural language processing (NLP) subjects from data wrangling to vectorization and topic modeling to state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep neural nets. Narrative sentiment analysis and SentimentArcs provide a NLP framework to explore the particularities of time-series analysis . Graph theory and network analysis introduces new methods to present, relate and compute metrics based on network representations. We study hands-on projects like analyzing the social network of Game of Thrones and trying to classify who\u2019s tweeting: Trump or Trudeau. The final week will focus on a variety of methods available to host presentations, ML/AI models or full applications on the web. This includes several free and paid web hosting options from no-code static blog platforms to dynamic web full-stack virtual servers on cloud hosts like Amazon Web Services. Students produce a wide variety of individualized stand-alone projects demonstrating specific learned skills. Our course culminates in a final class project centered on both each student's intellectual interests and personal passions implemented using any combination of the tools and techniques presented throughout the semester.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"IPHS 290: Computational Cultural Analytics Prof Elkins & Chun Integrated Program for Humane Studies Kenyon College Fall 2022","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Cultural analytics is the study of society and social phenomena by analyzing data and the way it flows.

This involves gathering, transforming, visualizing and narrativizing data in various forms including numeric, textual, geospatial, and as time series. This course presumes some coding experience or the introductory course to Digital Humanities, IPHS200 Programming Humanity. We start with geospatial data and mapping. Next, we\u2019ll build on our skills using web scrapers and API\u2019s to create original datasets from social media sites like Twitter. Then we\u2019ll learn various natural language processing techniques underlying sentiment analysis and topic clustering to explore text for insights. Finally, we'll learn how to graph and explore the relations between data in the form of social networks. This is a methods class focused on learning both the conceptual and practical applications of maps, texts, and networks. A carefully curated sequence of key abstract concepts explored through the most popular and useful libraries will mark our progression through the semester. We'll also read some of the best examples of work in the field and use these to inspire our own experiments. We\u2019ll do some hands-on projects on DataCamp like analyzing the social network of Game of Thrones and exploring the shifting topics/sentiment of Trump/Trudeau on social media. But we'll also have three project weeks during which we'll break into groups and move through the entire process, from brainstorming ideas to visualizing and analyzing the results. In the final segment of the course, we'll learn how to showcase projects on individual Github sites and work on final projects centered on individual interests. By the end of this course you will: Deepen your proficiency in Python, data visualization, and data wrangling Learn core Natural Language Processing techniques including scraping, cleaning, transforming and analyzing text Learn fundamental geospatial mapping Learn fundamental graph theory and applications Present your code on Github and project on a personal website Learn how to identify interesting multi-disciplinary research questions and judiciously use a wide range of computational technologies to analyze, critique and productively address such questions Grading 25% DataCamp 15% Reading/Concept Quizzes 40% 3 Mini-projects 20% Final Project There is no final exam Attendance In accordance with standard Kenyon policy, absences greater than 25% of the class will result in a failing grade. You are allowed three absences, no questions asked, before your attendance grade drops. These absences count as combination sick/personal days, i.e. please do not take 3 personal days and then ask for additional sick days. In cases of extreme illness or other unforeseen events, please ensure the advising office is aware and that you\u2019ve been granted an excused absence. We will be notified accordingly. Quizzes Short quizzes will test comprehension of key terms and information. Quizzes cannot be made up if you miss class. 3 quizzes will be dropped to accomodate 3 absences. Then the 3 lowest grades will be dropped. Datacamp Assignments and Mini-Projects You will receive a free Datacamp account with assignments due for each class session. Assignments are graded solely on completion, but you must complete them fully (i.e. no 0\u2019s). Please make sure the checkmarks are there on each section on the outline of the course. Final Project For the final project, you may a) complete a data analysis or cultural analytics project working with numeric or linguistic data or b) create an in-depth analysis of a particular technology. b) should demonstrate understanding of both the technology and the ethical/social issues surrounding that technology. Final Thoughts on Grades This class is meant to be a fun and exploratory introduction. Students will bring different strengths and backgrounds to this interdisciplinary class, and the emphasis will be on developing these personal interests and competencies. If you do the work, you will do well. Responsible Employee Information We will be studying and/or discussing a number of issues that may cause discomfort or distress. If you wish to speak with either of us about any readings, assignments or class discussions, please understand that we may be required to report information about sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator. For confidential support, you may contact the following resources: The Health and Counseling Center, Sexual Misconduct Advisors (SMAs) the College chaplains, and staff at New Directions Domestic Abuse Shelter & Rape Crisis Center Statement of Academic Integrity and Disability Accommodations At Kenyon we expect all students, at all times, to submit work that represents the highest standards of academic integrity. It is the responsibility of each student to learn and practice the proper ways of documenting and acknowledging those whose ideas and words they have drawn upon (see Academic Honesty and Questions of Plagiarism in the Course Catalog). Ignorance and carelessness are not excuses for academic dishonesty. If you are uncertain about the expectations for this class, please ask for clarification. Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may need academic accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see me as soon as possible.
