## Course Description

Cultural analytics is the study of society and social phenomena by analyzing data and the way it flows. This course presumes some coding experience or the introductory course to Digital Humanities, Programming Humanity. We’ll build on our skills using API’s to create original datasets from social media sites like Twitter. Then we’ll develop natural language processing skills including sentiment analysis and topic clustering to explore text for insights. We’ll also learn how to graph and explore social networks. In class, we’ll do some hands-on projects like analyzing the social network of Game of Thrones and trying to classify who’s tweeting: Trump or Trudeau. In the final segment of the course, students develop their own project centered on their interests.

This course assumes basic familiarity with Python or other programming language as taught in IPHS200: Programming Humanity. This course focuses on methodologies as well as some of the the most popular and useful technologies for computational digital humanities. By the end of this course you will:

* Deepen your proficiency in Python, data visualization, and data wrangling
* Learn core Natural Language Processing techniques including scraping, cleaning, transforming and analyzing text
* Learn fundamental geospatial mapping 
* Learn fundamental graph theory and applications
* Be able to present your work online in both static and dynamic web servers

**EDIT**
Gain a foundational understanding of key aspects of our Age of Information from Dataism and Information Theory to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
Relate this emerging picture to conversations about Humanism, Posthumanism, and Transhumanism.
Understand how new computational tools both challenge and deepen traditional approaches to the Social Sciences, Humanities, and Fine Arts.
Understand emerging ethical debates surrounding key technologies poised to transform humanity.
Have a portfolio of project-based work demonstrating your computational skills with a final project of your choice.


## Assignments

* 20% Attendance and Discussion

* 25% Quizzes

* 15% Mini-projects

* 25% Python programming exercises (10)

* 15% Final Project (1)

* Moodle gradebook will be updated regularly.


## Attendance

In accordance with standard Kenyon policy, absences greater than 25% of the class will result in a failing grade.


## Quizzes

Short quizzes will test comprehension of key terms and information. Quizzes cannot be made up if you miss class, but the lowest grade will be dropped.


## Mini-Projects and Final Project

You will receive a free Datacamp account with assignments due for each class session. Assignments are graded solely on completion, but you must complete them fully (i.e. no 0’s). 

Mini Projects will be assigned on DataCamp. They are more challenging and depending on the level of difficulty, we may use class time and group work to complete them.


## Final Thoughts on Grades

This class is meant to be a fun and exploratory introduction. Students will bring different strengths and backgrounds to this interdisciplinary class, and the emphasis will be on developing these personal interests and competencies. If you do the work, you will do well.


## Responsible Employee Information

We will be studying and/or discussing a number of issues that may cause discomfort or distress. If you wish to speak with either of us about any readings, assignments or class discussions, please understand that we may be required to report information about sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator.  For confidential support, you may contact the following resources: The Health and Counseling Center, Sexual Misconduct Advisors (SMAs) the College chaplains, and staff at New Directions Domestic Abuse Shelter & Rape Crisis Center.


## Statement of Academic Integrity and Disability Accommodations

At Kenyon we expect all students, at all times, to submit work that represents the highest standards of academic integrity. It is the responsibility of each student to learn and practice the proper ways of documenting and acknowledging those whose ideas and words they have drawn upon (see Academic Honesty and Questions of Plagiarism in the Course Catalog). Ignorance and carelessness are not excuses for academic dishonesty. If you are uncertain about the expectations for this class, please ask for clarification. Students with disabilities who will be taking this course and may need academic accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see me as soon as possible. Also, you are required to register for support services with the Office of Disability Services in the Olin Library, Center for Innovative Pedagogy.
