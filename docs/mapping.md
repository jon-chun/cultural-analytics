## Overview

The most popular stereotype of data is in the form of numeric tables or spreadsheets. In this course we introduce the other prominent classes of more complex data types. This includes geospatial, time series and network graphs which respectively emphasize the additional dimensional properties of data. Specifically, we will focus on the geospatial, temporal and network relationships between distinct entities. 

We begin the course with geospatial data types since this is perhaps the most intuitive for humans to understand, transform and analyze. Python geospatial libraries can be similiarly straightforward given the mental frameworks of Pandas dataframes and set theory. In particular, we will explore the functionality of two popular Python libraries for geospatial mapping: GeoPandas and GeoPy.

## Applications

- [Friday]  
    * [Land Acquisition and Dispossession: Mapping the Homestead Act, 1863-1912](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/homesteading/)


## Coding Practice

- [Monday]  
    * [GeoPy](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/07-Mapping/01-Mapping.html) Jupyter Notebook with Commentary (Read this Jupyter notebook for the big picture. We'll review the details and implement on Friday in lab)
    * Datafile for GeoPy Notebook: [ithica-places.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iEwKQVwugdxs8t_r5rAviUZUkYLer_EY/view?usp=sharing)
    * Jupyter [GeoPy Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uH4Trkt8ZI4Qg03KR0zW4Jzzr_fOd7Lh?usp=sharing)
    * Part 1: [Working with Geospatial Data in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/working-with-geospatial-data-in-python) (NOTE: This datacamp is a bit less clear than most because it assumes a few key bits of prior knowledge. Don't get hung up on any unstated assumptions, work through it as best you can, and bring any questions to class. We'll explain the finer points in class.)
- [Wednesday]  
    * Parts 2 & 3: [Working with Geospatial Data in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/working-with-geospatial-data-in-python)
- [Friday]  
    * Part 4: [Working with Geospatial Data in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/working-with-geospatial-data-in-python)
    


## Questions:

* Q: What does 'importance' mean in the statement: print(f"Importance: {location.raw['importance']}")
* A: Somewhat opaque answer in the [Geocoding Archives](https://www.google.com/search?q=nominatim+importance+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Flists.openstreetmap.org%2Fpipermail%2Fgeocoding%2F&oq=nominatim+importance+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Flists.openstreetmap.org%2Fpipermail%2Fgeocoding%2F&aqs=chrome..69i57.1441j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

## Project Ideas

* Find at least 2 disparate shape/location datafiles and plot them both onto the same map using GeoPy.
