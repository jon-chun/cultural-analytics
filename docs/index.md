**IPHS 290: Computational Cultural Analytics**  
**Prof Elkins & Chun**

**Kenyon College**  
**Fall 2022**  

## Overview

Cultural analytics studies society and social phenomena by analyzing data created by constitutent entities and their interactions. This course presumes some coding experience or the introductory course to Digital Humanities, [IPHS 200 Programming Humanity](https://programminghumanity.wordpress.com/) or the even more advanced course [IPHS 300 AI for the Humanities](https://aiforthehumanities.wordpress.com/). 

We begin with visualizing and analyzing ***geospatial data*** via maps and charts. We’ll build our skills with ***web scraping and API’s*** to create original datasets from websites and services like Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. 

Then we’ll study a variety of ***natural language processing (NLP)*** subjects from data wrangling to vectorization and topic modeling to state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep neural nets. 

[Narrative sentiment analysis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/what-we-publish/elements/cambridge-elements-series) and [SentimentArcs](https://github.com/jon-chun/sentimentarcs_notebooks) provide a NLP framework to explore the particularities of ***time-series analysis***. 

***Graph theory and network analysis*** introduce new methods to visualize, connect and compute metrics of related entities based on network representations. We study hands-on projects like analyzing the social network of Game of Thrones and trying to classify who’s tweeting: Trump or Trudeau. 

The final week will focus on a variety of options to share presentations, ML/AI models or applications on the web. This includes several ***free and paid web hosting options*** from no-code static blog platforms to dynamic web full-stack virtual servers on cloud hosts like Amazon Web Services.

Students produce a wide variety of individualized stand-alone projects to demonstrate specific learned skills. Our course culminates in a final class project based on each student's intellectual interests and personal passions. These compelling narratives are reconcieved and implemented using any combination of the technologies and techniques presented throughout the semester.
