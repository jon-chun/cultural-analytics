## Overview

This week you'll learn the basics of network analysis and the popular Python library NetworkX. We'll use graphs to model character interactions in Game of Thrones as well as understand the social networks of US politicians on Twitter. By the end of the week, we'll customize this to explore your own ideas in a project that will incorporate Twitter API, NLP and network analysis.
