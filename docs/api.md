## Overview


Data flows constantly over networks under two basic paradigms. Information flow between machines and humans take place via ***Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)*** like the command line or more intuitive drag-and-drop window systems like MacOS or Windows 11. 

Machine-to-machine (or software-to-software) communications usually take place at multiple levels of abstractions from low-level network protocols (e.g. TCP/IP) or high-level protocols (e.g. HTTP) or ***Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)***. Lower-level communication protocols are commonly situated within the [7-layer OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_protocols#cite_note-2) while most software APIs are usually structured by the standards of ***REST or GraphQL***.

GUIs focus on carefully representing, architecting and sequencing information to leverage human intuitions and cognitive processes. Web scraping in a laborious, error-prone and often restricted way to harvest information from web GUIs. On the other hand, Machine-to-machines API communications focus on interconnectivity, efficiency, robustness and security. 

This week we will study and write Python programs to communicate with the Twitter Application Program Interface (API) and emphasize the more universal principles of structured machine-to-machine communications using JSON.
