## Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the algorithmic processing of human written text and consists of a number of discrete/narrow tasks including:

* Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
* Word Tokenization, Sentence Boundary Detection and other Semantic Segmentation
* Part of Speech Tagging
* Sentiment Analysis
* Machine Translation
* Dialog/Chatbots
* Natural Language Generation
* ...and many more

NLP is a fascinating field of study since language is intimately tied to much of which makes us human from our individual cognition to our social dynamics.
