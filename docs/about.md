Jon Chun has degrees in electrical engineering, computer science and biomedical engineering with a focus on cognitive science from UC Berkeley and UT Austin. As a post-graduate American Heart Research Fellow, he conducted and published research in gene therapy and medical informatics.  He has also worked for the Advanced Light Source Group at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the semiconductor research consortium SEMATECH in Austin.  His research interests include Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing, Affective AI and XAI/FATE.

Professor Chun has co-founded several startups including as CEO and COO of the world’s largest anonymity service backed by large Wall Street hedge funds and the CIA’s venture fund In-Q-Tel. His specialization in cross-cultural experiences of technology stems from working and studying throughout the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America including the US Foreign Service Spanish Exam and the 日本語能力試験 (Japanese). Before arriving in Gambier he was a Director of Development for the world’s largest computer security corporation in Silicon Valley and Entrepreneur in Residence at UC Berkeley.

Jon is interested in bringing diverse voices to urgent debates surrounding technology’s growing impact on society. Since 2017 his courses, Programming Humanity and AI for the Humanities, have been the first curriculum specifically designed to bridge the gap between technology and the Humanities by provided an integrated intellectual framework grounded in the Liberal Arts and Artificial Intelligence.

## Digital Humanities and DHColab

Digital humanities at Kenyon encompasses a dual lens. We empower the next generation of thinkers with the conceptual framework underlying our Age of Information — from dataism and algorithmic thinking to synthetic biology and artificial intelligence. Our unique approach to computational thinking positions students to engage with the many practical, theoretical and ethical issues surrounding technological innovation and social change.

Digital humanities also explores the most recent computational approaches as a way to augment — rather than replace — more traditional humanist inquiry. Students imagine and pursue new avenues of research by identifying unexplored datasets of text, image and sound, while embracing new computational frameworks that are increasingly powerful and easy to use. We focus on finding interdisciplinary solutions to today's challenges.

Students interested in digital humanities are encouraged to start with our introductory course, "Programming Humanity." Advanced courses include "A.I. for the Humanities." All digital humanities courses are project-based, and students will have a portfolio of innovative projects by the end of their course of study.
