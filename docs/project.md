## Overview

Our course project will give you the opportunity to explore, learn and showcase applying one or more technical concepts/tools to a topic of your personal interest.  The focus will generally be on interpretation, critique and creativity to demonstrating domain expertise by applying commonly available ML/AI models rather than coding.  All projects will be submitted in the form of a presentation poster similar to many ML/AI courses in line with guidelines for Stanford Universityâ€™s CS230 project guidelines.
